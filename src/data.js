      "description": `When I was working on a scaffolder for Django some years ago,
      I needed to generate HTML menus for the apps I was generating, I didn't
      find anything but a very out-to-date project called django-menuware,
      I opened a few PRs to update the Django support to newer versions and
      adding support for Font Awesome icons but the author didn't want to add
      newer features. So, I asked him if I could fork the project and release it
      under a new name, he agreed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So, me together with [Juan Diego GarcÃ­a](https://twitter.com/juandgoc) started
      this repo as a fork from django-menuware but we actually changed the whole codebase
      added a lot of cool documentation in Read The Docs, new features, tests, CI integration with Travis,
      and a lot more.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      **This was my first official approach to Open Source as a maintainer** and **it helped me
      to understand all the phases of an OSS project**, we currently maintain it and
      if you want to generate Django Menus using Python Dictionaries from a file, this
      project is a very good option.`

      "description": `Some years ago, I wanted to create [my personal blog](${BLOG_LINK}) to use it as a
      learning tool, my idea was to write an article about each thing I was learning, that way I could
      remember it any time I need, and probably somebody could find the information useful.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My idea also was to stick to the Django ecosystem, which I love a lot, that's how I found the
      [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.io/) a django-developers-friendly CMS, after that, with some research
      I could find Puput, a Wagtail-based blog engine, so I started to develop my blog with it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Puput had some limitations by the time like no support for Django 2.0 or newer versions of Wagtail,
      so **I opened some PRs giving support to those versions**, and **cleaned a lot of the code and docs**
      with the time, [Marc TudurÃ­](https://twitter.com/marctuduri) the original author of the project and a very nice guy
      invited me to **become part of the maintainers team**, and with some time, **he granted me the role of main maintainer**
      since I was actively contributing to the project and he wasn't using it too much, I try to maintain the
      project nowadays`
