  "bio": `My name is Milton Lenis and I'm a **${ROLE}** from **Colombia**, currently based in **${CURRENTLY_BASED}**

  I'm a life-long learner, always excited to work on the most cutting edge technologies, ready to help and passionated about the things I do on a daily basis.

  I've always loved to create things with code since I was a Software Engineering student at Universidad del Valle where I discovered my passion
  for web development and python during the last years of my degree, in fact, I started my first job as a developer there.

  I've been working in web development on the Python ecosystem since 2015, I've faced several kind of projects, like **e-commerce, social media,
  fintech, Data Visualisation, and Multitenant (SaaS) platforms**.

  I also like to contribute to Open Source projects whenever I can, that's my way to thank the developers who create the cool tools
  I use on a daily basis.

  Another thing I enjoy a lot is to be part of programming communities where I've organized events like **local meetups, Django Girls Workshops,
  PyDays** and our national **PyCon**. Sometimes I also **give some talks**.

  When I'm not doing something related to programming I'm usually playing videogames or playing soccer with my friends. I also enjoy a wonderful
  life with my wife and our little dog Chili.

  Welcome to my page and please don't hesitate on checking every section you want to dig deeper about me, if you have any question feel free to

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Since I love a lot the clean and readable code, I decided to go with a talk about it. Python lets us write beautiful code
      using some popular ways to do certain stuff in a clean way called 'Pythonic Idioms', this is more of a community term than
      a language feature, but, if you follow the 'Pythonic Idioms' your code will be a lot better and less bug prone.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In this talk I covered all of the Pythonic Idioms I know and contrasted wrong ways of writing Python code vs the Pythonic way`

      "description": `When I was working on a scaffolder for Django some years ago,
      I needed to generate HTML menus for the apps I was generating, I didn't
      find anything but a very out-to-date project called django-menuware,
      I opened a few PRs to update the Django support to newer versions and
      adding support for Font Awesome icons but the author didn't want to add
      newer features. So, I asked him if I could fork the project and release it
      under a new name, he agreed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So, me together with [Juan Diego GarcÃ­a](https://twitter.com/juandgoc) started
      this repo as a fork from django-menuware but we actually changed the whole codebase
      added a lot of cool documentation in Read The Docs, new features, tests, CI integration with Travis,
      and a lot more.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      **This was my first official approach to Open Source as a maintainer** and **it helped me
      to understand all the phases of an OSS project**, we currently maintain it and
      if you want to generate Django Menus using Python Dictionaries from a file, this
      project is a very good option.`

      remember it any time I need, and probably somebody could find the information useful.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My idea also was to stick to the Django ecosystem, which I love a lot, that's how I found the
      [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.io/) a django-developers-friendly CMS, after that, with some research
      I could find Puput, a Wagtail-based blog engine, so I started to develop my blog with it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Puput had some limitations by the time like no support for Django 2.0 or newer versions of Wagtail,
      so **I opened some PRs giving support to those versions**, and **cleaned a lot of the code and docs**
      with the time, [Marc TudurÃ­](https://twitter.com/marctuduri) the original author of the project and a very nice guy
      invited me to **become part of the maintainers team**, and with some time, **he granted me the role of main maintainer**
      since I was actively contributing to the project and he wasn't using it too much, I try to maintain the
